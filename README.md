## About

It is a Face Recognition based System that recognizes the person in front of the Camera and records their name and time of entry.

Methodology followed:

- Finding all the faces
- Posing and projecting faces
- Encoding faces
- Finding the personâ€™s name from the encoding

## Update

I've tried implementing the same for a web application and built it successfully, but due to not getting free access to cloud storage, I've not put it on the web server. 

**Note: he implementation is crude for the web but can improve by using pre-trained models instead of calling face-recognition library.**
